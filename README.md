# GhabWindowLayout.spoon
Some windows functionalities in the form of a Spoon

The functionalities I have added in this Spoon: 
1. Move windows bit by bit in every direction. Bit is here defined as 20px. 
2. Move windows to a different space.
3. WIP: Load a default window layout, depending on the screens available.
4. WIP: Remember and restore the current window layout.
